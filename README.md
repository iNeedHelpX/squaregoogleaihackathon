### About me

* I run on a mac M1, iPhone XS Max and xcode simulator.

* VSCode is my IDE of choice.

* I don't own an android and have not tested my project on Android simulator. However this project is Android compatible. I have set it up to work on Android with my signing keys just in case. If needed I will send an APK file over!
